## PHoEnix Association presents

# **LTSPICE WORKSHOP**

## SUMMARY

1. **UNIT OF STUDY** : LTspice
2. **OBJECTIVE** : Teach the basic concepts of LTspice to prepare students for 2nd year
    courses and enable them to make a project based on it.
3. **TIME** : 5-6 hrs divided into 3 interactive live sessions.

### WHAT IS LTSPICE?

LTspice is a powerful, fast and free simulation software,schematic capture and waveform

viewer with enhancements and models for improving the simulation of analog circuits.

### WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH LTSPICE?

LTspice is majorly used in testing and simulation of analog circuits, this powerful tool can

be handy while building your very own project. LTspice is also used in PHoEnix CDCs,

and learning it will give you an edge compared to other peers. It also helps in a better

understanding of the theoretical concepts through hands on simulation and also ease the

learning process whenever these concepts are taught in class. It is used in courses like

‚óè DIGITAL DESIGN : CDC for ECE, EEE, ENI and CS.

## COURSE PLAN
Course plan is present inside the handout

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

LTspice needs to be downloaded. The links will be shared in the server.

## MATERIAL AND RESOURCES

Resources corresponding to the topics covered in each class would be provided as the

course goes on for better understanding and further reading.

## ASSESSMENT

Assignment needs to be completed to be eligible for the certificate.
