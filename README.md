**LTSPICE WORKSHOP**

![](RackMultipart20210718-4-4853i7_html_c5ebe8d276eafb50.png)

# **SUMMARY**

1. **UNIT OF STUDY** : LTspice
2. **OBJECTIVE** : Teach the basic concepts of LTspice to prepare students for 2nd year courses and enable them to make a project based on it.
3. **INSTRUCTOR** : Prateek Agarwal
4. **TIME** : 5-6 hrs divided into 3 interactive live sessions.

# **WHAT IS LTSPICE?**

LTspice is a powerful, fast and free simulation software, schematic capture and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for improving the simulation of analog circuits.

# **WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH LTSPICE?**

LTspice is majorly used in testing and simulation of analog circuits, this powerful tool can be handy while building your very own project. LTspice is also used in PHoEnix CDCs, and learning it will give you an edge compared to other peers. It also helps in a better understanding of the theoretical concepts through hands on simulation and alse ease the learning process whenever these concepts are taught in class. It is used in courses like

- **DIGITAL DESIGN** : CDC for ECE, EEE, ENI and CS.
- **ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS CIRCUIT LAB** : DEL for ECE, EEE and ENI.
